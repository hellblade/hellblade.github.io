This was one of the first game engines I ever used, starting back in 2007. I started off just making games in it and I ended up being part of the team and working on the project (mostly volunteer).

Over the years I have been involved with the following:

* Beta testing
* Imported, managed and edited new built-in resources created by contractors.
* Contributed to the 001 trailer
* Developed the graphic-separator and audio browser internal-use tools.
* Developed the integrated graphics editor
* Developed the integrated graphics effect editor

# Lost in Space
> [Play now at Itch.io](https://hellbladenz.itch.io/lost-in-space-webgl).

This was my game made for the 39th Ludum Dare. Made in a weekend in August 2017, with Unity 2017.1.

It was also updated in October 2017 with some small improvements.

## Description

You are stranded in space with a storm approaching which your ship is not protected against. You need to get to the closest space station in order to survive.
Keep pushing forward, each successive level gets bigger with more objects. Be on the lookout to replenish your power, you donâ€™t want to get caught with none. 


This game involves finding your way to the space station in order to complete the level. All you are given is a distance to the space station so must come up with your own path. Asteroids block your path and there are satellites around to help replenish your energy but can be heavily guarded.
Levels are procedurally generated.

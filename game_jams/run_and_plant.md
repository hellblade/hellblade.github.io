# Run and Plant
> [Play now at Itch.io](https://hellbladenz.itch.io/run-and-plant).  Available with WebGL or download.

This was my game made for the 41st Ludum Dare. Made in a weekend in April 2018, with Unity 2017.4.

I took to long to think of a theme so game is a bit rushed and basic.

## Description
The idea for it is a cross between an endless runner and a farming game. Find or buy things to plant. In a later run they will have grown and be ready to provide you with benefits.

The world is procedurally generated.

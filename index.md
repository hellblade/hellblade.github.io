Hello!

I'm Matt: a software developer, gamer, motorcyclist and hobbyist game developer (when there's time which is in short supply!).

This website shows off some of the game development and computer graphics related projects I have worked on over the years. Some have been lost due to hard drive failures and time so this site will help to preserve what remains.

Familiar with C# and Unity along with some experience of C++.

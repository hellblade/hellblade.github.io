# Insane

This game was heavily inspired by the Unreal game, which alongside Unreal Tournament were some of my favorite games at the time.

Insane was created in 001 Game Creator. It is a 2D action game with a touch of horror/survival elements.

## Story
The Prison Ship UPS Ravenger is in the process of a transfer mission. When the ship travels closer to a never explored planet, the ship is caught in the planet's gravitational field. The UPS Ravenger crash lands on the planet, and takes damage beyond repair. On board the ship is a prisoner with no known name, who manages to survive the crash and ventures from the ship.

## Notable features
These are some interesting features as part of the game which at the time were quite unseen in previous 001 games:

- 8 way directional flash light
- Custom dialog system, above heads
- Blood splatters based on damage
- Custom inventory system
- Custom HUD
- Environmental effects - such as getting set on fire and put out in water
- Auto saving and many other game options

## Download
[Download Demo 1.1](../../assets/Insane.exe)
This was released on January 1, 2011.

Note: This no longer seems work on the latest version of Windows. Can still be run in a Windows 7 or 8 VM. Videos will be recorded of a playthrough at some point.

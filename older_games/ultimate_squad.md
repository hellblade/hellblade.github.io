# Ultimate Squad
Ultimate Squad was created in 001 Game Creator. It is a 2D action game.

It is about being in a special squad made to protect people. In it you play through several different missions. Characters are based on people in the 001 community at the time so the names of characters don't mean much outside of that context.

This is from 2008 so is quite dated but can still provide a bit of fun. One thing to note is it doesn't have autosaving so it's best to save after missions so you don't have to begin from the start if you die. (The first mission can be quite a slog!)
